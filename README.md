# Natural Language Processing (NLP) Specialization

Natural Language Processing (NLP) is a field focused on enabling machines to understand and manipulate human language. As a key area within machine learning, NLP is widely applied in various domains, from analyzing text to building conversational agents. This Specialization offers a comprehensive approach to mastering NLP, covering both fundamental techniques and advanced deep learning models.

## <font color='blue'>**1. Linear Regression in PyTorch**</font>

In `Linear_regression_pytorch.ipynb`, I explore regression models to see how \( x \) affects \( y \).

- **Models**:
  1. Quadratic:  
     $y = b + w_1 \cdot x + w_2 \cdot x^2$
  2. Linear (with bias):  
     $y = b + w_1 \cdot x$
  3. Linear (without bias):  
     $y = w_1 \cdot x$

- **Approach**: Using Batch Gradient Descent to estimate coefficients and fine-tuning with different epoch counts and learning rates.

- **Goal**: Understand regression in PyTorch and optimize performance.

## <font color='blue'>**2. Manual Neural Network Calculations**</font>

In `NN_functions_calculations.ipynb`, I manually calculate functions used in neural networks.

- **Manual Gradients**:  
  Calculate gradients for:
  \[
  f(x,y) = \frac{x + \exp(y)}{\log(x) + (x-y)^3}
  \]

- **Softmax & Cross-Entropy Loss**:  
  Implement the softmax function and compute cross-entropy loss manually.

This project dives into the math behind PyTorchâ€™s neural networks.
